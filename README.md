**Adapted from [joyzoursky/python-chromedriver](https://github.com/joyzoursky/docker-python-chromedriver)**

*I decided to experiment with different base images and other options in an attempt to fix an issue where text was being cut off from a PDF generated using chromedriver.*

## Usage

```Dockerfile
FROM vcoppola/python-chromedriver:2.7
```
